# Examples of OCaml with C interface

My examples of using OCaml with C and/or C++

This project comes with a devcontainer and Dockerfile that can be used together or separated. 

If you don't know what the devcontainer is for, you simply install the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` extension on VSCode, make sure you have docker installed and with your user in the docker group, and then simply you open this project on VSCode and it will ask to open in a dockerized environment with everything ready for compiling and running OCaml and C/C++ code.
